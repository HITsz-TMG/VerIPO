        "processed_question": "Which of the following best explains why the phone is still able to receive incoming calls?\nA. The mesh size is much smaller than the wavelength of both the incoming and outgoing signals, so the cage blocks both equally, but the phone is more sensitive to incoming signals than the detector is to outgoing signals.\nB. The cage allows the higher frequency incoming signals to penetrate due to their shorter wavelengths while blocking the lower frequency outgoing signals emitted by the phone.\nC. The electromagnetic waves emitted by the phone are reflected back by the cage, causing interference patterns that reduce the signal outside, while incoming signals penetrate the mesh due to its geometric configuration.\nD. The wire mesh cage attenuates electromagnetic waves differently depending on their propagation direction; the phone's antenna can receive incoming signals through small apertures in the mesh.\nE. The phone uses a different frequency for receiving signals than for transmitting, and the cage selectively blocks the transmitting frequency but allows the receiving frequency to pass through.\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

The induced current in the white ring creates a magnetic field opposing the coil's magnetic field, effectively increasing the coil's impedance, and decreasing the audio output volume.\nC. The white ring forms a resonant LC circuit with the coil, causing resonance at certain frequencies that attenuate the audio signal, resulting in decreased output volume.\nD.

The dielectric gas increases the capacitance of the electroscope, allowing it to accumulate more net charge, which causes greater divergence of the leaves.\nC. The dielectric gas serves as an insulating layer that prevents charge induction, so no net charge is transferred, and the leaves do not diverge.\nD. The dielectric gas alters the potential difference, changing the electrostatic forces between the leaves and resulting in a different degree of divergence.\nE.

The presence of the stick enhances the electric field around the wig, increasing the electrostatic forces and causing the hair strands to be momentarily attracted before repelling again.\nD. The hair strands are attracted to the stick because it emits charges opposite to those on the hairs, and upon balancing the charges, the hairs return to their prior position.\nE. The stick causes a redistribution of charges within the hair strands, leading to dipole formation that results in temporary attraction followed by repulsion when the dipoles diminish.\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

The speedometer will read a higher speed than the actual speed because the larger wheels cause the cable to rotate faster.\nB. The speedometer will display the same speed as before, but the actual vehicle speed will be higher for the same reading due to the increased wheel circumference.\nC. The speedometer will automatically adjust and display the correct speed despite the wheel size change.\nD. The speedometer will malfunction because the larger wheels disrupt the magnetic interaction within the speedometer.\nE. The speedometer will read zero because the increased wheel size disengages the speedometer cable.\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."
